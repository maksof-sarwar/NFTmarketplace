OnChain Rarity Calculator
Overview
This project is a protocol designed to calculate rarity on-chain for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It directly fetches metadata from the blockchain and computes a score for each trait, allowing for the ranking of NFTs based on their rarity.

Features
Fetch metadata directly from the blockchain
Calculate rarity scores for each trait
Rank NFTs based on their rarity scores
Suitable for integration into rarity platforms, NFT marketplaces, and similar applications
Installation
Copy code
npm install onchain-rarity-calculator
Usage
javascript
Copy code
const { calculateRarity } = require('onchain-rarity-calculator');

// Example usage
const nftMetadata = {
    tokenId: '0x123...',
    traits: {
        trait1: 10,
        trait2: 5,
        // Add more traits as needed
    }
};

const rarityScore = calculateRarity(nftMetadata);
console.log('Rarity Score:', rarityScore);
